# Nellix's Milkplayer

A html player i made that is openable in browser with visualizers and effects
The UI and other stuff is designed and referenced by Milk outside a bag of milk outside a bag of milk, a game that i absolutely love and relate to

You can edit and make your own versions of this player, i dont really mind at all
But please, leave me as a author of the project. Thanks!

# What can you do?

You can drag your music files to your browser page and you see the songs inside the player list, aint that cool?
Several visualizers in live feedback, by that i mean you can apply effects and see how they change the waveform
Background effects and trials!
Volume control, speed control
